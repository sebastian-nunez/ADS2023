# Stacks - LIFO

## Car Fleets

_In order by Starting Positions (shortest length goes at the end)_

1. Put last car into the Stack
2. Look at the next car, does it catch up? If it does, we don't add it to the stack
3. 3

## Recursion by Iteration

> **Claim:** Any problem that can be done recursively can also be done iteratively.

### Stack vs. Queue

> This approeach works a Queue too!
>
> Difference between **Depth-First-Search (DFS)--** STACK and **Breath-First-Search (BFS)-- Queue**

### Making Change

```python
def make_change(n):
    stack = deque()

    stack.append(n)
    while stack:
        top = stack.pop()
        if top == 0:
            return True

        if top < 0:
            stack.append(top - 19)
            stack.append(top - 11)
            stack.append(top - 6)

    return False
```
