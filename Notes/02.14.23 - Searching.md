# Searching

> Looking to see if an element is present or the index of the element.

## Linear Search - O(n)

- **Best Case:** 1st element is the target
- **Worse Case:** element is at the end, or at the end
- Even if the list is sorted, we still have to check every element

## Binary Search - O(logn)

> **Note:** the list must be sorted!
> Choose a middle index inside a high and low bound: see where you target lies.
>
> 1. If the target is less than the middle: high is now the middle (look to the left)
> 2. If the target is greater than the middle: low is now the middle (look to the right)
> 3. You have found the value
>
> **Midpoint:** low + (high - low) // 2
>
> **What is Log base 2 of X?**
>
> - _"How many times can we split X in half before weâ€™re only left with 1?"_
> - For 10x the input size, the log(n) version increases by approximately 3

### Iterative

**Time**: O(log)

**Space**: O(1)

```python
def binary_search(nums, target):
    lower = 0
    upper = len(nums) - 1

    while lower <= upper:
        mid = lower + (upper - lower) // 2

        if target < nums[mid]:
            upper = mid - 1
        elif target > nums[mid]:
            lower = mid + 1
        else:
            return mid

    return -1

print(binary_search([1,2,3,4,5], 4)) # 3
print(binary_search([1,2,3,4,5], 8)) # -1
```

### Recursive

**Time**: O(log)

**Space**: O(1) \* logn (stack frames) -> O(log)

```python
def binary_search_recursive(nums, target):
    def helper(lower, upper):
        if lower > upper:
            return -1

        mid = lower + (upper - lower) // 2

        if target < nums[mid]:
            return helper(lower, mid - 1)
        elif target > nums[mid]:
            return helper(mid + 1, upper)
        else:
            return mid

    return helper(0, len(nums) - 1)

print(binary_search_recursive([1,2,3,4,5], 4)) # 3
print(binary_search_recursive([1,2,3,4,5], 8)) # -1
```
