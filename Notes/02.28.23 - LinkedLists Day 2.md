# More LinkedLists

## Temporary Pointers

```python
def zipper_2(head1, head2):
    temp1 = head1
    temp2 = head2

    while temp1 and temp2:
        next1 = temp1.next
        next2 = temp2.next

        temp1.next = temp2
        temp2.next = next1

        temp1 = next1
        temp2 = next2

    return head1

head1 = head_from_list([8, 6, 7, 88, 53])
head2 = head_from_list([16, 12, 50])

pretty_print(zipper_2(head1, head2)) # 8 -> 16 -> 6 -> 12 -> 7 -> 50 -> 88 -> 53
```

## Dummy Nodes

> Dummy nodes help you get rid of edge cases where you need to add to an empty LinkedList, or where you are trying to remove/skip the first value of a LinkedList.

### Append

> Skip to the second last node (the node that points to None) and set it's next to a new node
>
> **Note:** you don't want to set the tail to None, so you have to traverse while tail.next exists

```python
def append(head, x):
    new_head = ListNode('dummy', head) # dummy head points to beginning on the LinkedList

    tail = new_head
    while tail and tail.next:
        tail = tail.next

    tail.next = ListNode(x)

    return new_head.next
```

### Even/Odd

```python
def even_odd(head):
    even_head = ListNode('dummy')
    odd_head = ListNode('dummy')

    tail = head
    while tail:
        if tail.val % 2 == 0:
            # append to even
        else:
            # append to odd

        # advance tail
        tail = tail.next

```

## Head and Tail

> Efficient when adding to both ends of the LinkedLists.
>
> **Note:** keep in mind, you have to set the `new_tail.next` to `None` after all the filtering was done.

```python

# Splits the LinkedList into even and odd numbers. Returns the head of a LinkedList that has evens then odd numbers.
def even_odd(head):
    even_head = ListNode('dummy')
    even_tail = even_head # used to traverse the even linked list

    odd_head = ListNode('dummy')
    odd_tail = odd_head # used to traverse the odd linked list

    tail = head
    while tail:
        if tail.val % 2 == 0:
            even_tail.next = tail
            even_tail = even_tail.next
        else:
            odd_tail.next = tail
            odd_tail = odd_tail.next

        tail = tail.next

    # clean up the tails (accounts for extra values)
    even_tail.next = None
    odd_tail.next = None

    even_tail.next = odd_head.next

    return even_head.next

```

## Auxillary Data Structures

> These problems can _almost always_ be solved without auxiliary data structures, be very mindful of your extra space complexity.
>
> But just in case this saves you in an interview some day...

### Finding the Intersection (Auxillary)

```python
def intersection_auxillary(head1, head2):
    seen = set()

    tail1 = head1
    while tail1:
        seen.add(tail1.val)
        tail1 = tail1.next

    tail2 = head2
    while tail2:
        if tail2.val in seen:
            return tail2

        tail2 = tail2.next

    return None
```

### Finding the Intersection (No Auxillary)

1. Find length of both lists
2. Calculate the offset between the lists (offet = abs(len1 - len2))
3. Move which ever list is longer by offset steps
4. Advance boths lists together until they meet

```python
def intersection(head1, head2):
    tail1 = head1
    head1_size = 0
    while tail1:
        head1_size += 1
        tail1 = tail1.next

    tail2 = head2
    head2_size = 0
    while tail2:
        head2_size += 1
        tail2 = tail2.next

    tail1 = head1
    tail2 = head2

    offset = abs(head1_size - head2_size)
    if head1_size > head2_size:
        for _ in range(0, offset):
            tail1 = tail1.next
    elif head2_size > head1_size:
        for _ in range(0, offset):
            tail2 = tail2.next

    while tail1 and tail2:
        if tail1 == tail2:
            return tail1

        tail1 = tail1.next
        tail2 = tail2.next

    return None
```
