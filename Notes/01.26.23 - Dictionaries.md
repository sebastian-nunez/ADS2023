# Dictionaries, Associative Arrays

## Abstract Data Type

A **data structure** is the implementation of an **Abstract Data Type**. Moreover, an Abstract Data Type is a mathematical model: it defines the methods used to manipulate data (you don't know how the ADT was implemented)

## Associative Array ADT

> Consist of (key, value) pairs of data

### Supported Operations

- insert
- replace
- lookup
- remove

## Dictionaries

> O(1) access, insert, lookup, remove
>
> The **keys** can be any immutable type: int, float, str, tuple etc.
> The **values** can be ANY TYPE. Lists, dictionaries, str etc.

```python

store = { # initialize
    'banana': 2,
    'eggs': 3,
    'bread': 10
}

# lookup
eggs_count = store['eggs']

# replace
store['bread'] = 4

# insert
store['kiwi'] = 12

# remove
del store['eggs'] # can't remove if its not there

# clear
store.clear()
```

### Iterating through Dictionaries

> Can't guarantee the specific order of the items in the dictionary

```python
store = { # initialize
    'banana': 2,
    'eggs': 3,
    'bread': 10
}

for key in store.keys():

for key in store:
    print(key)

for value in store.values():
    print(value)

for key, value in store.items():
    print(key, value)

```

## Counting and defaultdict

> You can use dictionaries to keep frequency maps of items

### Counting

```python
votes = [...]

for vote in votes:
    if vote not in

```

### Default Dictionary

> https://replit.com/@AlejandroOliva7/Exercise-212-Counting-and-defaultdict#election_winner.py

```python
from collections import defaultdict

tally = defaultdict(int) # values not in the dict, it will be initialized to 0
votes = [...]

for vote in votes:
    tally[vote] +=
```

```python
from collections import defaultdict
import math


def election_winner(votes):
  freq_map = defaultdict(int)

  winners = []
  most_votes = -math.inf

  # get the frequencies
  for vote in votes:
    freq_map[vote] += 1

  # find the winner frequency
  for vote in freq_map.values():
    if vote > most_votes:
      most_votes = vote

  # get all winners with the winner frequency
  for person, vote in freq_map.items():
    if vote == most_votes:
      winners.append(person)

  return winners

election_votes = ['Mo', 'Tristan', 'Mo', 'Mikayla', 'Mikayla']

print('election_winner', election_winner(election_votes))
```
