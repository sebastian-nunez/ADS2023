## Lists Methods

- clear()
- extend()
- sort()
- append()
- pop(), pop(i)
- remove(element)
- reverse()
- copy() -> **Shallow Copy**
- copy.deepcopy() -> have all the same objects and values but they don't have the same address

## Call by Object Reference

> "=" vs. clear then extend

The '=' will allocate new memory for the variable. Will erase the reference to the previous address

## Immutable/Mutable Objects

> Be deliberate whether or not you want to modify inputs

## Immutable

- Strings, int/floats, Booleans, Tuples

## Mutable

- lists, dict, set

## Accumulator Pattern

> Set variable, add to it then return the value

```python
def find_total(nums):
    total = 0
    for num in nums:
        total += num

    return total
```

```python
def minimum(nums):
    smallest = math.inf
    for num in nums:
        if num < smallest:
            smallest  = num
    return smallest
```

## List Comprehension

> **Notation:** [**value** for **element** in **collection** if **condition**]

```python
def square(nums):
    return [num** for num in nums]
```

## Tuples and Unpacking

> Immutable lists

```python
circle = (1, 2, 3)
x, y, z = circle # Unpacking

people = [("Sebastian", "Nunez"), ("John", "Doe")]

for firstname, lastname in people:
    print(firstname, lastname)
```
