# Complexity

## Time Complexity - Worst Case Scenario

> The **amount of time** it takes to run a program, in terms of the **size of the input**
> We care about large inputs (millions)
>
> **n** is typically the number of inputs:
>
> - Ignore constants
> - Ignore the smallest terms -> 4n^3+ n^2 + 4 = O(n^3)

### Common Time Complexities

1. **Constant O(1)** - HashTable lookup, insert, delete; Linked list insert, delete
2. **Logarithmic O(logn)** - Binary search; Balanced binary tree lookup, insert, delete
3. **Linear O(n)** - Linear search, Linked list
4. **n log n O(nlogn)**- Merge Sort
5. **Quadratic O(n^2)** - Bubble Sort
6. **Exponential O(2^n)** - Solving the traveling salesman problem using dynamic programming
7. **Factorial O(n!)** - Solving the traveling salesman problem via brute-force search

### Examples

```python
for i in range(n)
    for j in range(n)
        # O(n^2)

for i in range(n)
    for j in range(i, n)
        # O(n^2)

# Built in functions
max(), min(), sum() -> O(n)
```
